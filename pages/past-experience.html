        <h3>Circo Bar - Supervisor</h3>
        <p>Since January of this year I have been working as a supervisor of a bar. My responsibilites have inlcuded opening and locking up the venue, making sure all stock orders are placed, received, and handled properly, the rota for all staff members, and finally, the running of busy shifts in which we may have up to 13 staff members working at once.  This has been extremely challenging and required vast amounts of leadership but I have thrived in this environment.</p>

        <h3>Circo Bar - Team Leader</h3>
        <p>After finishing University I took over a small leadership role as a team leader at the student bar in which I had worked during University.  I was given more responsibilites as the managers felt that I could be trusted, and because of my past leadership experience which allows me to effectively communicate and drive other team members.  They also felt I was a commited individual with an eagerness to to excel. I enjoyed this job as it was my first attempt at leadership in a job role.</p>

        <h3>Circo Bar - Bar Staff</h3>
        <p>During my final year at University I worked for nine months at my local student bar.  During this time I became extremely knowledgeable on the running of the business and was often given extra responsibilites beyond my job role as my bosses felt I was trustworthy and professional.  I placed special emphasis on my appearance, and time organisation, making sure to always fulfill my duties with eagerness.</p>

        <h3>Pitcher & Piano - Bar Support</h3>
        <p>During my second year at University I worked for six months as bar support at a busy cocktail bar in Birmingham city centre.  This was a challening environment as it was always busy and I was required to work quickly and efficiently.  While the role was simple, it was also demanding, and required me to work in a state of continous high pressure.  I base some of calmness under pressure on this early role.
