        <h3>About Myself</h3>
        <p>My name is <b>Matthew Murphy,</b> and I am a Software Test Consultant in training.  I am currently in training for thirteen weeks at the Sparta Global academy in Birmingham City Centre, and after completion of my training I will commence my two years as a fully fledged consultant working for Sparta Global.</p>
        <p>I am an extremely driven individual with a passion for technology, I am hoping to combine the two things to build a career in technology.  While this will be my first job in technology, I have been interested in it for many years, studying the different coding languages and frameworks at home, while learning some more of the fundamental aspects at University. </p>
        <p>I recently finished University, graduating from the University of Birmingham with a 2:1 (with honours) in Computer Systems Engineering. I hope to put the skills I acquire at University to use in the working world.</p>

        <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
        <p><b>Leadership, </b>I am a natural leader and have shown this over the years through many different types of commitments. At University, I led my second year group project, in my part time work I was a supervisor at a bar, and in my spare time I used to run a local 6 a side football team.</p>
        <p><b>Resilience, </b>I consider myself to an extremely resilient person, who along with high ambitions, also has the ability to work hard and trudge on despite ongoing difficulty. I showed this especially during my A-levels when I highly exceeded my inital predicted grades.</p>
